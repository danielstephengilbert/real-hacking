10pm - 12am
- Found my driving motivator, and decided to embrace it.
- Wrote a guiding document.
- Determined that "real-world" hacking is the only hacking worth pursuing.
- Brainstormed clever ways to survey the Internet for common infrastructure.
- The goal would be to learn how to hack the technology with the greatest ROI.
- Keep in mind, this is not to do so illegally, but rather to know how.
- Signed up for a Shodan account.
- Determined that money is required to get started.
- Holding off on Shodan for now.
- Thought of ways to protect myself while performing scanning and enumeration.
- Re-visited Tor, and researched how to proxy traffic such as nmap through Tor.
- Learned about data leaks while using tools on Tor.
- Thought of different ways to configure my setup either at home or otherwise.
- Once I saw the leaked traffic problem about Tor, I decided to explore it more.
- Decided before I cut my teeth with that, I need to learn clearnet traffic.
- Opened Wireshark on my host, and started capturing all the data for my system.
- Noticed a lot of IPv6 traffic.
- Learned how to disable IPv6 in my host OS.
- Left IPv6 enabled so I could learn more about the traffic that was being sent.
- The first packet in the capture was an LLMNR protocol packet.
- Learned about LLMNR and why it's potentially a security issue.
- Apparently, LLMNR provides local name resolution, and can be hacked.
- Would lookup PoC and test exploitation, but need to configure my lab first.
- May take a breadth-first survey of the other packets before explore LLMNR.
